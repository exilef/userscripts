Userscripts for Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey

lturbahn.user.js
----------------

Userscript that saves form data entered in the payment form of
bahn.ltur.com in Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey local storage and refills the
form on the next visit. Optionally stores XOR-encrypted credit card data
if a key is supplied.

To clear the stored data reload the page and choose no when asked if the
data should be restored. Then answer yes in the next dialog asking 
whether the data should be cleared.
